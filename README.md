## Hi there ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

## My name is Jorge Monge, and I am an architect that morphed into a GIS analyst that morphed into a software developer. What a ride!

I live in Canada and I work for Fujitsu Consulting, with a focus, right now, on geospatial web development with Javascript and React. I might be considered a "jack-of-all-trades" having worked in:
  - the back-end with NodeJS and C# .NET.
  - relational databases like PostgreSQL/GIS and SQL Server, including advanced SQL queries and functions/procedures.
  - the front-end with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS, React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS.
  - front-end mapping libraries like Leaflet and the ArcGIS JS API.
  - Python for a variety of things (automatic PDF mapping, Esri's ArcGIS Online content management, and many more)
 
 I studied:
  - Architecture in the Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid (Masters degree)
  - Geographic Information Systems at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) (Applied Bachelors degree)
  - Front-end web development at the University of Calgary (Certificate)
  - C# .NET development at the University of Calgary (Certificate, ongoing)
  - ... and I continue to study/learn every day!

Feel free to drop me a line at gis@jorgemonge.ca

Thanks! ðŸ˜Ž
